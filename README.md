The Batteries Mod adds a few tiers of Battery items that the player can charge using Forge Energy (FE) that, when enabled and in the player's inventory, will provide power to other FE-based items automatically.

Shift+Right-Click with a Battery in-hand to enable/disable. An enabled battery will have a glowing Enchantment effect to indicate it is ready to charge other items.
A Creative Battery is also available.

Currently, the mod assumes that you have another method to charge batteries (probably the same method you used to charge whatever item it is that this battery will charge!). In the future, a standalone Charging machine will be implemented.
